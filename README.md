[![Wellenplan banner](https://github.com/wellenplan/.github/raw/main/assets/banner.jpg)](https://github.com/wellenplan/wellenplan)

Wellenplan is a content management system for broadcast/radio content.

Think about it like a web content management system, but for radio.
It's focus is on planning and scheduling content much more than it
is about publishing said content.

Wellenplan is currently in development and is not yet ready for use.
